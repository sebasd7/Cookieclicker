					<p><big>Alright, let's make some stuff!</big></p>
					<br>
					<h1>First : a few things</h1>
						<h2>What's a random generator?</h2>
							<p>A random generator is a simple application that produces random text at the click of a button. There are generators that output random names, others that write descriptions of strange imaginary monsters, but you could imagine a generator for just about anything - such as a generator that returns a random story, or a random cooking recipe!</p>
						<br>
						<h2>So how do I make a generator?</h2>
							<p>Well, it's fairly easy. All generators in RandomGen are simply text files that our website converts into generators.<br>
							To make your own generator, you will have to write that text file using the syntax described below (you'll see, you can do all kinds of neat stuff). Here's what a finished generator source file looks like : <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cKeB4v4J" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cKeB4v4J</a>. Pretty readable, huh?</p>
							<p>You will then have to find a place online to store your text file (<a href="http://pastebin.com/" target="_blank">pastebin.com</a> is a good one; your text files are hosted for free and, if you register, you can edit them as much as you want. <a href="http://www.topsite.com/best/paste" target="_blank">Here are some other text-hosting sites</a>).</p>
							<p>Once you're happy with your new generator, all that remains to do is to share it with the world!</p>
						<br>
						<h2>How do I use my generator once it's written?</h2>
							<p>To use a generator, take its source file's URL and append it to <b>http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=</b>.<br>A generator stored at <b>www.example.com/mygenerator.txt</b> would be usable at <b>http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=www.example.com/mygenerator.txt</b>.
							<ul>
								<li><b>Note : we seem to be having problems with pastebin.com right now.</b> Probably a bandwidth limit being reached. Sorry!</li>
								<li>If your generator is hosted on pastebin.com, you only have to refer to its identifier (the letters at the end of its url). For example, <a href="http://pastebin.com/cKeB4v4J" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/cKeB4v4J</a> becomes <a href="randomgen/_gen_cKeB4v4J.html" target="_blank">http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=cKeB4v4J</a>.</li>
								<li><b>Note :</b> when hosting your file on pastebin.com, make sure you're registered - or you won't be able to edit your generator later! Also make sure to set the file to never expire, and to make it either public or unlisted.</li>
								<li>If you're not hosted on pastebin.com, make sure your file is a .txt file! Your generator won't work with any other file type.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
						<br>
						<h2>General tips about writing generators</h2>
							<p>
							<ul>
							<li>You can make a generator for practically <i>anything</i>.</li>
							<li>Spend some time examining the sources of other generators, you'll probably learn a lot.</li>
							<li>Test your generator. <i>A lot.</i></li>
							<li>Keep backups of your generator's source - you never know!</li>
							<li>Adding a description, picture, and some nice formatting can really help your generator stick out.</li>
							<li>Beware of spelling mistakes, they can quickly make a generator appear very unprofessional. Use spell-check!</li>
							<li>This page doesn't include all the tricks and subtleties of RandomGen - again, check out the source of existing generators, and see what's happening on the <a href="http://forum.dashnet.org/categories/rg-general-discussion" target="_blank">RandomGen forums</a>!</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
						<br>
					<h1>Writing source files</h1>
						<h2>Quick overview</h2>
							<p>
							To create a random generator, you simply have to define lists of things that reference each other. For example :<br>
							<pre>	$animal
	cat
	dog
	fish
	$phrase
	My pet is a [animal].
	I am feeding my [animal].
							</pre><br>
							This will generate sentences such as "My pet is a cat", or "I am feeding my fish".<br>
							The last list declared will be used as the base generator (in this case : $phrase).<br>
							You can change how many items are generated by adding "<pre>&amount=10</pre>" to the url; you can also change the base generator by adding "<pre>&seed=element</pre>".<br>
							</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Global settings</h2>
							<pre>$name : My Generator</pre><br>
							<pre>$author : Author</pre><br>
							<pre>$description : Description of my generator</pre><br>
							<pre>$picture : http://.../pic.png</pre><br>
							(should be 128x128px)<br>
							<pre>$amount : 3</pre><br>
							sets the default amount of results the generator should yield<br>
							<pre>$button : Another!</pre><br>
							sets the text for the "Generate" button<br>
							<br>
						<h2>Inclusions</h2>
							<pre>$include http://url.com</pre><br>
							This adds to your generator everything defined in the generator at the specified URL.<br>
							Inclusions should always be declared at the top of the file, before any other data.<br>
							Try to use as few inclusions as possible, as they make the loading time for your generator much longer.<br>
							You are encouraged to create "utility generators" full of lists (such as names or colors) that other people can include in their own generators to expand them easily.<br>
							<br>
						<h2>Creating lists of elements</h2>
							<pre>$animal</pre><br>
							Starts a new list with the identifier "animal".<br>
							<pre>$+animal</pre><br>
							Starts adding elements to the list with this identifier. This is good for expanding on included lists.<br>
							<pre>fish</pre><br>
							Adds a new element named "fish" to the current list.<br>
							<pre>fish {20%}</pre><br>
							Adds a new element to the current list, but this element will only have a 20% chance of being added to the random selection table.<br>
							<br>
						<h2>Nesting elements</h2>
							<pre>I own a [animal].</pre><br>
							[animal] will be replaced by a random element from the $animal list.<br>
							<pre>I need a quick random [word|term|thing to say].</pre><br>
							This returns one of the elements between brackets at random, without needing to create a separate list.<br>
							Can even be nested with regular lists, as such :<br>
							<pre>I am eating a [[fruit]|[vegetable]|[candy]].</pre><br>
							This can quickly get complicated - make sure to keep track of your brackets!<br>
							<br>
						<h2>Identifiers</h2>
							<pre>My pet is a [animal,#pet]. I've always wanted a [#pet].</pre><br>
							Remembers the animal by its identifier (#pet) and returns the same animal in both instances.<br>
							<pre>My [#pet]'s name is [name,#name,written]. Would you like to see [#name]?</pre><br>
							Adding "written" will record the element as its literal representation, instead of its generator. This is necessary in some cases.<br>
							<br>
						<h2>Attributes</h2>
							Check this out :<br>
							<pre>	$animal
	cat {action:meows}
	dog {action:barks}
	fish {action:swims}
	$phrase
	I have a [animal,#pet]. My [#pet] is [#pet,as action].
							</pre><br>
							This is a bit trickier. The syntax {attribute:value} will add custom properties to elements which can be referred to later. You could use this for things such as gender, verb tenses, alternate descriptions, and so on.<br>
							<pre>My [#pet] is [#pet,as action,or sleeping]</pre><br>
							This defines what to fall back to ("sleeping") if the specified attribute doesn't exist for an element.<br>
							<br>
						<h2>Utilities and other fun things</h2>
							<pre>There are [100-10000] leaves here.</pre><br>
							Returns a random number between two bounds.<br>
							<pre>My name is [random syllable,x2-6].</pre><br>
							The "x2-6" will return between two and 6 of the specified element.<br>
							<pre>There is [an] [word].</pre><br>
							[an] will be replaced by "a" or "an", depending on the next letter.<br>
							<pre>Look at all the [animal][s]!</pre><br>
							[s] will replace the previous word to its proper plural (this is not fool-proof and can sometimes return silly results).<br>
							<pre>The book's cover reads "[book name,title]".</pre><br>
							The "book name" will have title-like capitalization ("my cat has asthma" will be converted to "My Cat Has Asthma").<br>
							<pre>Look at my [animal]. Look At My [Animal]. LOOK AT MY [ANIMAL].</pre><br>
							The engine will detect the proper letter case and will respectively return : "Look at my cat. Look At My Cat. LOOK AT MY CAT."<br>
							This might not always work; if you need to capitalize something like [#pet], you can write [#1,Abc].<br>
							<br>
						<h2>Formatting with html</h2>
							Finally, you can use some <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">html tags</a> to add a bit of formatting.<br>
							Tags allowed are &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;u&gt;, &lt;q&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; / &lt;h2&gt; / &lt;h3&gt; and &lt;br&gt;.<br>
					<br>
					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
						<h2>Closing words</h2>
